This Google clone was built with React for front-end rendering and DOM manipulation, Context API and React hooks for state management, and JavaScript promises to fetch data from the Google Search API.  To improve user experience, I utilized Context API and the 'createContext' hook to wrap the App component in a ThemeContext provider, rendering a button that toggles between a light theme and dark theme.

## Dependencies

1. Material UI for icons
2. Node Sass for styling (including light and dark mode)
3. React Router DOM to create URLs that route to different components
